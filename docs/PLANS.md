# CppCmakeProjectTemplate — Plans & Capabilities

This document lists the project's current capabilities, governance policies, and roadmap in priority order.

---

## ✅ Current Capabilities

### Unified CLI & Tooling Framework

- **Unified CLI (`tool.py`):** A single entrypoint that manages all commands (`build`, `lib`, `sol`) and dynamic plugins (`plugins/`).
- **Modern Directory Layout:** Clear separation between infrastructure (`core/utils`), command logic (`core/commands`) and plugins (`plugins/`).
- **Structured Logging:** Standard log levels and persistent log storage.
- **Standardized Results:** Commands return a `CLIResult` and support `--json` for automation.
- **Clean Environment:** Legacy scripts consolidated into a single professional interface.

### Recent Additions

- **Shared Session Persistence:** `scripts/core/utils/common.py` now provides `load_session()`, `save_session()`, and `backup_session()` used by both `tool.py` and `tui.py` via a shared `.session.json` file.
- **Verification Harness:** `scripts/verify_full.py` automates build/test/extension and library flows and logs results to `build_logs/verify.log` for reproducible verification.
- **Python Environment Automation:** `scripts/setup_python_env.py` creates cross-platform virtual environments (`--recreate`, `--install`) and a CI workflow `.github/workflows/create_envs.yml` creates envs on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows.
- **Extension Packaging Hardened:** Extension build flow hardened; `extension/package.json` includes a minimal `build` script and the packaging step reliably produces a `.vsix` under `extension/`.
- **Versioning & Release:** Project version synchronized (bumped) and tag `v1.03` created and pushed; packaging and release steps were exercised in the verification run.
- **Library Packaging Helpers:** `core.libpkg` refactored to a modular helper surface; `tool lib` commands use these helpers for create/export/remove flows.
- **Cleanup & Consolidation:** Legacy shim files removed or consolidated under `scripts/core/`; helpful debug logs added under `build_logs/`.
- **Logging & Performance:** Logger I/O path optimized and small helper functions cached to reduce repeated file reads.

### Build System

- **Modern CMake (3.25+):** Target-based structure with no global flags.
- **Preset Matrix:** Ready presets for Linux, Windows, macOS and Embedded (ARM).
- **MSVC Consistency:** Automatic selection of `/MT` or `/MD` when appropriate.

### Compile-time Build Metadata

- **Per-Target BuildInfo:** Per-target versioning and git metadata support.
- **Dynamic Feature Flags:** Feature toggles controlled at build time.

- **Build Configuration Summary:** The build system now emits `build/build_config.json` at build time. This JSON contains the active `--profile` (for example `normal`, `hardened`, `extreme`), selected sanitizers, the chosen CMake preset/toolchain, and a list of headers or sources generated at configure/generation time. This artifact is intended for CI traceability, debugging, and reproducing the exact configuration used to produce an artifact.

### Quality & CI/CD

- **Testing:** Support for GoogleTest, Catch2, Boost.Test and QTest.
- **Quality Gates:** ASan, UBSan, TSan, Clang-Tidy and Cppcheck integration.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions multi-platform matrix builds.

## 🚀 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation & Unified CLI — Completed

- **Modular Dispatcher:** ✅ DONE
- **Command Contracts:** ✅ DONE
- **Structured Logging:** ✅ DONE
- **Plugin Discovery:** ✅ DONE
- **Migration & Cleanup:** ✅ DONE (legacy scripts consolidated)
- **Refactoring & Core Migration:** ✅ DONE (command logic moved under `core/commands`)

### Phase 2: Distribution & Template Engine — Completed

- **Jinja2 Migration:** ✅ DONE — Integrated for `libpkg` and `sol` subsystems with fallback behavior.
- **Packaging:** ✅ DONE — Extension packaging hardened; `tool` metadata added to `pyproject.toml`.
- **Bootstrap (`tool setup`):** ✅ DONE — Venv bootstrap and dependency installation supported.
- **Rollback & Recovery:** ✅ DONE — Robust `Transaction` helper integrated project-wide for atomic file operations.

### Phase 3: Test Strategy & Structured CI (Status & progress) - Completed

- **Comprehensive Testing (in-progress):** ✅ DONE - Library management commands (`rename`, `move`, `remove`) are now transactional and include project-wide CMake reference updates. Highlights:
  - **`rename`:** updates source files, headers, and CMake target references atomically under the repository `Transaction` helper; supports `--dry-run` preview for automation and safety.
  - **`move`:** moves the library directory under `libs/` and the corresponding test directory under `tests/unit/`, and updates `libs/CMakeLists.txt` and `tests/unit/CMakeLists.txt` registrations. If the destination basename differs from the original library name, the tool can perform token replacement inside moved files and update CMake target references to keep targets consistent.
  - **`remove`:** detaches the library from the CMake registration and, when `--delete` is supplied, deletes files from disk. After deletion the tool prunes empty parent directories under `libs/` and `tests/unit/` to avoid orphaned folders.
  - **Safety & UX:** All operations run under the `Transaction` helper for backup and rollback on error. For destructive `--delete` removals the CLI prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` is provided; use `--dry-run` to preview actions without applying them. Programmatic calls (tests/scripts) bypass interactive prompts.
- **Dependency Awareness:** ✅ DONE — `tool lib tree` and `tool lib info` now parse actual CMake dependencies.
- **Project Health:** ✅ DONE — `tool lib doctor` detects and guides fixing of orphaned entries and broken include structures.
- **Deterministic CI:** ✅ DONE — Optimized CI with caching, conditional builds, and cross-platform verification.
- **App Scaffolding:** ✅ DONE — `tool sol target add` implemented for automated app creation.

### Phase 4: Safety, Hardening & Sanitizers (Rust-like C++ Safety) — Completed

- **Multi-Tiered Security Profiles:** ✅ DONE — Implementation of progressive safety levels.
  - **`normal`**: Base warnings (`-Wall -Wextra`).
  - **`strict`**: Aggressive warnings (`-Wconversion`, `-Wshadow`, etc.).
  - **`hardened`**: `strict` + `-Werror` + `-fstack-protector-strong` + `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` + `-fPIE`.
  - **`extreme`**: Full "Rust-like" safety. `hardened` + `uninitialized-init` + `-fno-exceptions` + `-fno-rtti` + Full RELRO + `-pie`.
- **Granular Sanitizer Selection:** ✅ DONE — Separated from profiles, allowing combinations with any safety level.
  - Usage: `tool build --sanitizers asan ubsan` or `tool build --sanitizers all`.
- **Granular Control (Per-Target Overrides):** ✅ DONE — Any security or sanitizer feature can be enabled/disabled per library or application.
  - Usage: Pass `-D<TARGET_NAME>_ENABLE_HARDENING=ON/OFF` or `-D<TARGET_NAME>_ENABLE_ASAN=ON/OFF`.

#### Planned Actions (priority order)

  1. Consolidate CI workflows and reduce duplication — ✅ DONE (composite actions and initial refactor applied).
  2. Add `--install` to top-level scripts and provide a unified install helper — ✅ DONE (`core.utils.common` now exposes optional provisioning and scripts accept `--install`).
  3. Add `.cmake-format` and a CI formatting job (auto-fix candidate generation) — ✅ DONE (`.cmake-format` and CI job added).
  4. Complete AFL++ integration: enable `afl-clang-fast` builds in CI, seed-corpus upload/retention, and long-run nightly fuzz jobs — ✅ DONE (AFL++ build + nightly long-run workflow added; seed corpus present and artifact retention implemented).
  5. Expand analyzer granularity: document and expose per-script and per-target analyzer toggles — ✅ DONE (Granular Control expanded and toggles exposed in `core` and CMake modules).
  6. Add per-library `docs/` and `LICENSE` files (automatically generated by `tool lib` in the future) — ✅ DONE (each library under `libs/` includes `docs/README.md` and `LICENSE`).
  7. Automate `clang-tidy --fix` PR flow: generate candidate fixes, open PRs, and gate re-enablement of strict analyzers behind review — ✅ DONE (`tool format tidy-fix` + CI job added; PR automation is configured to produce diff artifacts and auto-PR is scaffolded).

  8. Granular Control: expose per-target and per-script toggles in `core.utils.common` and CMake modules — ✅ DONE (global `--install`, per-target `-D<TGT>_ENABLE_*` and analyzer toggles implemented).

  Status update (2026-04-01): The Phase‑4 planned items listed above have been implemented and validated in this feature branch.

- Seed-corpus triage & minimization pipeline: ✅ DONE — implemented in `scripts/fuzz/triage.py` and `scripts/fuzz/findings_collector.py`. The corpus manager and AFL findings collector support `afl-cmin`/`afl-tmin` where available and provide safe fallbacks.
- `clang-tidy --fix` PR automation: ✅ DONE — implemented as `scripts/ci/tidy_pr_bot.py` and CI job scaffolding to generate candidate fix branches and PRs (uses `tool format tidy-fix` under the hood).
- Workflow consolidation: ✅ DONE — reusable workflow added at `.github/workflows/reusable-ci.yml` and key callers (nightly AFL long‑run) updated to use it. This significantly reduces duplication across CI jobs.

  Notes: Remaining follow-ups are operational tuning and incremental improvements (artifact retention policy, alerting thresholds, and coverage of additional fuzz targets). These are tracked in the repository issue tracker.

- **Dynamic Static Analysis:** ✅ DONE — `.clang-tidy` is now dynamically generated based on the active profile (`normal`, `strict`, `hardened`, `extreme`) using Jinja2 templates.
  - `hardened/extreme` profiles enforce `WarningsAsErrors: "*"`.
  - `extreme` profile enables additional aggressive safety checks by removing suppressions.
- **Security Audit Command:** ✅ DONE — New `tool security scan` command for CVE and static security analysis.
- **CVE Scanning:** ✅ DONE — Integrated `osv-scanner` for dependency vulnerability auditing.
- **Security Audit:** ✅ DONE — `tool security scan` with OSV-Scanner + Cppcheck, `ci_security_policy.py` for tiered policy enforcement (CRITICAL→fail, HIGH→warn), and `security_scan.yml` CI workflow with artifact upload.
- **Fuzz Testing:** ✅ DONE — libFuzzer harness, AFL++ CI (nightly long-run) and seed-corpus support added.
- **Static Analysis:** ✅ DONE — `clang-tidy --fix` automation (`tool format tidy-fix`) and CI job added.
- **Security Hardening:** ✅ DONE — `cmake/Hardening.cmake` implements stack canaries (`-fstack-protector-strong`), stack clash protection, PIE (`-fPIE`/`-pie`), RELRO (`-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`), CFI (`-fcf-protection`), `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2/3`, per-target overrides, and MSVC equivalents (ControlFlowGuard, /GS, /sdl, Qspectre).

Notes & recent decisions (implemented / important constraints):

- **Build-time generated headers:** Some headers are produced during configure/generation by CMake or project scripts. These generated files are recorded in `build/build_config.json` and are treated as "generated sources" by the analyzer policy to avoid false-positives originating from generated code. This analyzer scoping does not remove hardening flags from production targets — it only narrows which files will fail CI due to stylistic analyzer rules. To include generated headers in analysis, enable per-target analysis flags (for example `-D<target>_ANALYZE_GENERATED=ON`) or run `tool format tidy-fix` to apply automatic fixes before re-enabling strict analyzer policies.

- **Preserving Hardening Semantics:** Hardening compiler/linker flags (`-fstack-protector-strong`, `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, PIE/RELRO, etc.) remain applied to production libraries and executables by default. Analyzer exclusions are narrowly scoped (third-party dependencies, generated headers, and test/fuzz harness targets) to avoid CI failures on non-actionable warnings. If you prefer stricter enforcement, enable per-target analyzer checks or use the `extreme` profile which tightens checks further.

- **Fuzz Testing (current status):** ✅ Complete — libFuzzer + AFL++ integration, seed-corpus management (`scripts/fuzz/triage.py`), nightly long-run CI jobs, and automated crash triage (`scripts/fuzz/findings_collector.py`) are all implemented.

- **clang-tidy --fix automation:** A `tool format tidy-fix` helper and a CI job (`.github/workflows/clang_tidy_fix.yml`) were added to run `clang-tidy -fix` and produce the resulting diff/artifact for review. This facilitates safe re-enabling of analyzers by producing fix-candidates that can be reviewed and merged incrementally.

- **Security-scan CI reporting & policy:** ✅ Complete — `tool security scan` integrated with CI artifact upload, tiered policy enforcement via `ci_security_policy.py` (CRITICAL→exit 2, HIGH→exit 1), and `security_scan.yml` workflow with checkout, Go setup, and policy evaluation steps.

### Granular Control — Expanded ✅ DONE

All per-script and per-target toggles are now implemented and available as `-D` CMake options for targets and as CLI flags for scripts.

- **Build / CMake / Tooling**: ✅ `--profile` (`normal|strict|hardened|extreme`), `--sanitizers` (asan,ubsan,tsan), `--preset`, `-D<TARGET>_ENABLE_HARDENING`, `-D<TARGET>_ANALYZE_GENERATED`, `-D<TARGET>_ENABLE_ASAN`.
- **Fuzzing**: ✅ `-DENABLE_FUZZING`, `-DENABLE_AFL`, `--timeout-ms` (triage.py), `--target` / `--corpus-root` (corpus_manager.py).
- **Security Scan**: ✅ `--install`, `--format json|text`, `--fail-on-severity` (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), `--suppressions <file>`.
- **clang-tidy / format**: ✅ `format tidy-fix`, `--dry-run`, `--apply`, `--checks <pattern>`.
- **CI / Automation**: ✅ `--skip-ci` (local debug), `--ci-mode` (smoke|full|nightly), `--report-artifact` (path), `--retain-days` (artifact retention policy) — all exposed in `tool.py` global flags and `GlobalConfig`.
- **Release & Packaging**: ✅ `--install`, `--dry-run`, `--signing-key` (GPG tag signing), `--publish` (release publish subcommand).

- **Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO):** ✅ DONE — `cmake/PGO.cmake` supports two-phase PGO (generate/use) for GCC, Clang, and MSVC. CLI: `tool build --pgo generate|use --pgo-dir <dir>`. Per-target override: `-D<TARGET>_ENABLE_PGO=ON/OFF`.
- **Link-Time Optimization (LTO):** ✅ DONE — `cmake/LTO.cmake` with `CheckIPOSupported`, per-target support, thin LTO for Clang. CLI: `tool build --lto`. Per-target override: `-D<TARGET>_ENABLE_LTO=ON/OFF`.
- **Build Caching:** ✅ DONE — `cmake/BuildCache.cmake` auto-detects and configures ccache/sccache as compiler launcher. `-DENABLE_CCACHE=ON` (default). Override: `-DCACHE_PROGRAM=/path/to/ccache`.
- **Build Visualization:** ✅ DONE — `tool perf graph [--render] [--format svg|png|pdf]` generates CMake dependency graph via `cmake --graphviz` with optional `dot` rendering.
- **Hot Reloading:** Explore hot-reloading capabilities for faster development iterations.
- **Cross-Compilation:** ✅ DONE — 3 new toolchains (`aarch64-linux-gnu`, `arm-cortex-m0`, `arm-cortex-m7`) + 5 new CMake presets (`embedded-cortex-m0/m4/m7`, `gcc-debug/release-static-aarch64`).
- **Embedded Targets:** ✅ DONE — `cmake/EmbeddedUtils.cmake` rewritten with 4 functions: `add_embedded_binary_outputs`, `add_embedded_map_file`, `embedded_print_memory_usage`, `target_set_linker_script`. 3 new toolchains + 3 new embedded presets.
- **Code Size Analysis:** ✅ DONE — `tool perf size` analyzes all built binaries/libraries with human-readable output and JSON report. Auto-detects active preset build directory. Uses `size` (berkeley format) for section breakdown.
- **Build Time Analysis:** ✅ DONE — `tool perf build-time` analyzes Ninja `.ninja_log` for per-target build times, or runs a timed rebuild with JSON report output.
- **Compiler Explorer Integration:** Integrate with Compiler Explorer for easy access to assembly output and compiler insights.
- **Performance Profiling Integration:** Integrate with profiling tools (e.g., `perf`, `VTune`, `Instruments`) for streamlined performance analysis.
- **Automated Performance Regression Detection:** Integrate performance benchmarks into CI to automatically detect regressions.
- **Documentation of Performance Best Practices:** ✅ DONE — `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` created with comprehensive guide covering ccache/sccache, LTO, thin LTO, PGO two-phase workflow, `perf size`, `perf build-time`, CMake configure summary table, and recommended release profile. `docs/BUILD_SETTINGS.md` and `docs/BUILD_INFO.md` also updated.
- **Performance Annotations:** ✅ DONE — `libs/dummy_lib/benchmarks/bench_greet.cpp` demonstrates `[[likely]]`/`[[unlikely]]`, `ATTR_HOT`/`ATTR_COLD`/`ATTR_PURE`/`ATTR_NOINLINE` cross-platform macros, `SetBytesProcessed`, `SetItemsProcessed`.

### Phase 6: Ecosystem & UI — ✅ DONE

- **TUI as Wrapper:** ✅ DONE — `tool tui` dispatches to `scripts/tui.py`. `tui/` app already wired via CORE_COMMANDS `"tui": "tui"`.
- **Live Doc Server:** ✅ DONE — `tool doc serve [--port N] [--open]` serves `docs/` via Python `http.server`. `tool doc list` shows all 15 documents. `tool doc build` supports mkdocs/sphinx.

### Phase 7: Configuration & State Management — ✅ DONE

- **`tool.toml`:** ✅ DONE — `tool.toml` at project root contains 9 sections (`[tool]`, `[build]`, `[perf]`, `[security]`, `[lib]`, `[doc]`, `[release]`, `[hooks]`, `[embedded]`). Read by `scripts/core/utils/config_loader.py` via `tomllib` (Python 3.11+) with `tomli` fallback and minimal built-in parser. Values flow into `GlobalConfig` at dispatcher startup. CLI args always take precedence.
- **State Persistence:** ✅ DONE — `.tool/state.json` session history managed by `scripts/core/commands/session.py`.

## Versioning & Release Workflow

We standardize on a single source-of-truth `VERSION` file at the repository root.
The format is: `<major>.<middle>.<minor>+<revision>` (e.g. `1.2.3+45`). The
`+<revision>` part is optional and used for build metadata (CI run number or
build counter).

Key elements:

- `VERSION` (root): canonical version string used by `scripts/release.py` and
  consumed by `scripts/tool.py` via `GlobalConfig.VERSION` at runtime.
- `scripts/release.py`: CLI helper to `bump`, `set`, `set-revision`, and
  `tag`.
- `tool release`: wrapper that delegates to `scripts/release.py` so releases can
  be run via the unified CLI (e.g. `python3 scripts/tool.py release bump minor`).
- `CMakeLists.txt`: reads `VERSION` and uses the three-part base version for the
  `project(... VERSION ...)` invocation; build metadata (`+revision`) is not
  passed to CMake project but is available to packaging and docs.
- CI: `.github/workflows/release.yml` derives a revision (GitHub `run_number`) and
  runs `scripts/release.py` on tag push or via `workflow_dispatch` (dry-run by
  default; set `apply: true` on dispatch to perform commit/tag/push).

Workflow summary:

1. Developer runs `python3 scripts/tool.py release bump patch` (or `bump minor/major`).
2. `scripts/release.py` updates `VERSION`, synchronizes `pyproject.toml`,
   `extension/package.json`, and top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, then commits.
3. Optionally `scripts/release.py tag --push` will create and push `v<major>.<middle>.<minor>`.
4. CI (`release.yml`) can be used to set the `+revision` metadata automatically
   and optionally publish artifacts.

This approach centralizes version management, reduces accidental drift, and
provides both manual CLI and CI-driven release paths.

- **Lock Files:** Deterministic dependency management via lock files.

## Git leak detection (gitleaks) — ✅ DONE

- **Pre-Commit Hook:** ✅ DONE — `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with gitleaks v8.18.4 hook (blocks commits with secrets), plus pre-commit-hooks, ruff, cmake-format, clang-format.
- **CI Integration:** ✅ DONE — `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` scans all push/PR events + weekly schedule. SARIF upload on failure. PR commenting via `GITLEAKS_ENABLE_COMMENTS`.
- **Custom Rules:** ✅ DONE — `.gitleaks.toml` with 3 custom rules (CMake private key, SSH credentials, API Bearer tokens) and project-specific allowlists.
- **Reporting & Alerts:** ✅ DONE — SARIF reports uploaded to GitHub Security; CI workflow fails on detected secrets.

---

## 📜 Governance

- **SemVer:** Semantic versioning for CLI and templates.
- **LTS Support:** Maintain both Latest and LTS release streams.

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Keep Template Logic Minimal:** Keep template files small; implement complex logic in Python.
2. **Atomic Operations:** Ensure file mutations support rollback.
3. **Static Analysis Integration:** Integrate `clang-tidy --fix` into the `check` command to improve quality.

## Long-Term Vision

Once everything is completed, only Python scripts will remain; there will be no pre-existing CMake or C++ source files. All CMakeLists.txt and .cpp / .h files will be generated entirely by the scripts. In this way, the project structure will be programmatically defined and managed by the scripts, increasing flexibility while minimizing manual intervention.

### Final Goal: Cargo + Cookiecutter + Bazel + IaC (Infrastructure as Code) Pattern

The entire C++ project structure should be generated by scripts,
and those scripts should manage the full lifecycle of the project.
